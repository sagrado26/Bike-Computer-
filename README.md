Bike computer is an electronic device that is used in monitoring the speed of the bicycle as it travels 
over a distance. This device is perfect for tracking how fast and how long a bike user has been on the road. A 
must-have device for cyclist that allows you to determine the speed through the LCD display which can 
be a fantastic motivation tool when working out. This device can also serve as a reminder in regard to
safety for cyclist on the road to remind themselves of the speed they are going at in order to avoid road 
accidents. Fitted navigation button to navigate through the whole system, users can manually adjust 
features such as brightness control, contrast level display, timer, etc. With brightness control, users can 
control how bright they want the device to illuminate which is perfectly suited for those who prefer cycling 
at night. A contrast control can manually be adjusted to preferred level when the default display is not 
ideal for the user. To which the whole operation of the bike computer is processed by a single 
microcontroller called, MSP430. This device is a low powered device fitted with voltage regulators which 
can guarantee that the circuit will run smoothly when fitted with a 9V battery. Inside the report 
entails the full description used components used and its operation.
